The code defines a number of endpoints (i.e., routes starting with “/”) as well as several helper and background functions. Here’s a breakdown:

Flask Endpoints (Routes)
/ (index):
Returns a welcome message ("Welcome to the Detection App").

/favicon.ico:
Serves the favicon from the static directory.

/video_feed:
Streams JPEG frames as a live video feed.

/stream:
Provides a simple HTML page that embeds the live video feed.

/control_panel:
Serves the control panel HTML file (control_panel.html) from the configured directory.

/start (POST):
Activates detection by setting a global flag to True.

/stop (POST):
Deactivates detection by setting the global flag to False.

/status (GET):
Returns the current status of detection (active/inactive).

/config (POST):
Updates the configuration (like filter classes and logging settings) and saves it to a JSON file.

/log (GET):
Queries Firestore for the 10 latest detections and returns them as JSON.

/speak (POST):
Receives a voice command message and uses the espeak command to speak it aloud.

Utility and Background Functions
read_label_file(file_path):
Reads and processes the label file (e.g., coco_labels.txt) to create a mapping of IDs to labels.

load_config():
Loads configuration from a JSON file if it exists, providing default settings otherwise.

calculate_distance(actual_width, focal_length, bounding_box_width):
Uses a simple formula to estimate the distance of an object based on the bounding box width.

measure_distance(h, trigger_pin, echo_pin, timeout=0.02):
Handles ultrasonic sensor measurements by triggering a sensor and calculating the distance based on the echo time.

ultrasonic_loop():
Runs in a background thread; it continuously measures distances using multiple ultrasonic sensors and updates a global readings dictionary.

detection_loop():
Also running in a background thread, it captures images from the camera, processes them using a TensorFlow Lite model, annotates frames (with bounding boxes, labels, distances), logs detections to Firestore, and saves 5-second video clips.

Application Startup
In the main section, the code starts both the ultrasonic_loop and detection_loop in separate daemon threads and then runs the Flask application (using Flask-SocketIO) to serve these endpoints.

This setup creates an integrated system that:

Continuously detects objects and calculates distances.

Provides live video streaming.

Logs detections and sensor data to Firestore.

Allows for remote control through HTTP endpoints.
